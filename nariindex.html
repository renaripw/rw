				<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, and welcome to my ePorfolio. My name is ReNari Wells. I am a class of 2025 graduate of
				   Auburn University. I'm currently finishing up my final semester at Wallace Community College Selma
					to recieve my associate's degree in Computer Information Systems. I plan to further my education in mortuary school.
                    I have always been a fan of anatomy. I plan to further my educatio to become a Licensed funeral Director,
                    Embalmer, and eventualy get my Doctorates in Physical Therapy.  I love doing hands on activities
                    so I want my occupation to be based on that. I am big
					on God and family. For without him, I am nothing.
				</p>
				<p>
					On this page, you will see five different pages including the one you are on now which is the "Home"
					Page. Next is the "Coursework" page where you will be able to see the classes I have taken at WCCS.
					Then, there is the "Hobbies" page ,which is my favorite, you will find what I do outside of school
					work and maybe even a song you might want to add to your playlist. Last but not least is the
					"Contact Me" page where you will put your information so I can reach you. Thank you again for
					stopping by!
